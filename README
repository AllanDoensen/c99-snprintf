The snprintf(3) implementation shipped with Mutt
------------------------------------------------

The Mutt project (http://www.mutt.org/) ships an snprintf(3) implementation
which is based on Patrick Powell's code.  The C99-snprintf code is in turn
based on the version included with Mutt 1.5.12.  A copy of this version is
included in this commit.
